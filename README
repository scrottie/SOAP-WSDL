INTRO

SOAP-WSDL provides a SOAP client with WSDL support.

This is a developer release - everything may (and most things will) change.

INSTALLING
----------

Use the following mantra:

 perl Build.PL
 perl Build
 perl Build test
 perl Build install

If you don't have Module::Build installed, you may also use 

 perl Makefile.PL
 make 
 make test
 make install

Note that Module::Build is the recommended installer - make will not run 
all tests provided with SOAP-WSDL.
