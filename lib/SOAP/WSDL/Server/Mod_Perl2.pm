=head1 NAME

SOAP::WSDL::Server::Mod_Perl2 - mod_perl based SOAP server using SOAP::WSDL

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl module providing a mod_perl2-based SOAP server using SOAP::WSDL

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Configuration is managed through the use of PerlSetVar directives.
The following variables are available:

=head2 dispatch_to

Takes as a single argument the package name of the module which contains
the methods which handle SOAP requests.

 PerlSetVar dispatch_to "WebPackage::SOAPMethods"

=head2 soap_service

Takes as a single argument the package name of the Server module
generated by SOAP::WSDL using

 wsdl2perl.pl --server file:///path/to/your/wsdl

By default, the name of the package is MyServer::$SERVICENAME::$PORTTYPE.

EXAMPLE: Given this sample WSDL which wsdl2perl.pl was run against to generate
perl packages:

    <wsdl:portType name="WebServiceSoap">
        [...]
    </wsdl:portType>

    [...]

    <wsdl:service name="WebService">
        <wsdl:port name="WebServiceSoap" binding="tns:WebServiceSoap">
            <soap:address location="http://www.example.com/WebService"/>
        </wsdl:port>
    </wsdl:service>

The following directive would be correct:

    PerlSetVar soap_service "MyServer::WebService::WebServiceSoap"

=head2 transport_class [OPTIONAL]

Takes as a single argument the package name of the perl module containing a
handle() method used to assemble the HTTP request which will be passed to the
methods in your L<dispatch_to> module (see above). A default handle() method
is supplied in this module which should handle most common cases.

handle() is called with the following parameters:

 $r - Apache::RequestRec object

=head2 Undocumented methods

=head3 handle

=head3 handler

=head1 EXAMPLES

The following snippet added to httpd.conf will enable a SOAP server at
/WebService on your webserver:

    <Location /WebService>
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlResponseHandler SOAP::WSDL::Server::Mod_Perl2
        PerlSetVar dispatch_to "WebPackage::SOAPMethods"
        PerlSetVar soap_service "MyServer::WebService::WebServiceSoap"
    </Location>

=head1 PERFORMANCE

On my machine, a simple SOAP server (the HelloWorld service from the examples)
needs around 20s to process 300 requests to a CGI script implemented with
SOAP::WSDL::Server::CGI, around 4.5s to the same CGI with mod_perl enabled,
and around 3.2s with SOAP::WSDL::Server::Mod_Perl2. All these figures
include the time for creating the request and parsing the response.

As general advice, using mod_perl is highly recommended in high-performance
environments. Using SOAP::WSDL::Server::Mod_Perl2 yields an extra 20% speedup
compared with mod_perl enabled CGI scripts - and it allows one to configure
SOAP servers in the Apache config.

=head1 THREAD SAFETY

SOAP::WSDL uses Class::Std::Fast, which is not guaranteed to be threadsafe
yet. Thread safety in Class::Std::Fast is dependent on whether

 my $foo = $bar++;

is an atomic operation. I haven't found out yet.

A load test on a single CPU machine with 4 clients using the worker mpm
did not reveal any threading issues - but that does not mean there are none.
