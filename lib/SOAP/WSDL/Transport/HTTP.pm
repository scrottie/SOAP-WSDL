    # what's this all about?
    # unfortunately combination of LWP and Perl 5.6.1 and later has bug
    # in sending multibyte characters. LWP uses length() to calculate
    # content-length header and starting 5.6.1 length() calculates chars
    # instead of bytes. 'use bytes' in THIS file doesn't work, because
    # it's lexically scoped. Unfortunately, content-length we calculate
    # here doesn't work either, because LWP overwrites it with
    # content-length it calculates (which is wrong) AND uses length()
    # during syswrite/sysread, so we are in a bad shape anyway.
    #
    # what to do? we calculate proper content-length (using
    # bytelength() function from SOAP::Utils) and then drop utf8 mark
    # from string (doing pack with 'C0A*' modifier) if length and
    # bytelength are not the same

    # use bytes is lexically scoped
    my $bytelength = do { use bytes; length $envelope };
    $envelope = pack('C0A*', $envelope)
        if length($envelope) != $bytelength;

        $endpoint,
        [   'Content-Type', "$content_type",
            'Content-Length', $bytelength,
